This repository contains the evaluation of two popular NoSQL key-value store databases - Couchbase and ScyllaDB. The purpose of this evaluation is to compare their performance, scalability, ease of use, and features to help developers and system architects make informed decisions when choosing a database solution for their projects.

This project was implemented as part of the "Information Systems" course at the School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).

## About Couchbase
Couchbase is a distributed NoSQL database that provides a flexible JSON data model with a key-value store. It supports high availability and horizontal scalability, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases, including real-time analytics, mobile applications, and caching layers.

## About ScyllaDB
ScyllaDB is a high-performance NoSQL database built on Apache Cassandra's architecture. It is designed to provide low-latency, high-throughput data access, making it an excellent choice for applications that require fast data retrieval and real-time analytics.

## Methology 

We conducted benchmark tests using representative workloads. The evaluation process is thorougly docuemented, and the results are presented in a comparative analysis format.
